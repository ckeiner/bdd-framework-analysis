# BDD-Framework-Analysis

This project showcases the problems outlined in my masterthesis.

Examined frameworks are:

* [Spectrum](https://github.com/greghaskins/spectrum)
* [Serenity](http://www.thucydides.info/#/)
* [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/)
* [Test-Bddy](https://github.com/ckeiner/Test-Bddy)


Some of the tests rely on Neodymium and Posters. For further information, please refer to [this project](https://github.com/Xceptance/neodymium-example#how-to-try-it-out).
